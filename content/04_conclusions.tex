\begin{frame}{On the limitations of this work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Only MST data was used so far \rightarrow{} Optimize parameters using LST data also
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [\rightarrow] Another grid search only for LST data is necessary
        \end{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{1em}
        \item Efficiency was prioritized over angular resolution due to more statistics
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [\rightarrow] Another user might want a better angular resolution instead
        \end{itemize}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item The hyperparameters found in this work improved the performance of the algorithms
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item [\rightarrow] All algorithms have better efficiency and angular resolution compared to the default settings
                \end{itemize}
                \item The \texttt{FACTImageCleaner} is the best performing algorithm
                \item Prioritizing efficiency over angular resolution resulted in better metrics for all algorithms
                \item [\rightarrow] Further analysis and a broader grid search may still lead to even better-suited hyperparameters
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item [\rightarrow] This work can be used as a starting point for further optimization (also for LST data)
                \end{itemize}
